### Why?
As a weekend exercise, I wanted to redo my portfolio page without a framework, so I used vanilla html, css, and javascript with some jQuery and PHP. It ended up looking way better, and it was very satisfying to not lean on a framework or UI package. It ended up being a refreshing little exercise.
